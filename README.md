# Wikipedia Redefined
![Wikipedia Redefined Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramon82/wikipedia-redefined.php/master/preview.png)


## A different way to read wiki articles. 
This is a side project to achieve a new layout for Wikipedia. The original idea came from Wikipedia Redefined (http://wikipediaredefined.com) by NEW! agency (http://newisnew.lt/en). 

As you can see, this code was written a very long time ago and will not be updated. I made this code just for studies, but you can fork it if you want to contribute or build your own Wikipedia :)

## Installation
To install this, just copy to a directory and edit the configuration.php

For now, this code is just the redesigned home page of Wikipedia.org and the
article page. If you can, please contribute by adding more functionalities.


## File structure
See [`FILE-STRUCTURE.md`](https://github.com/ramon82/wikipedia-redefined.php/blob/master/FILE-STRUCTURE.md)
